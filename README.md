Hello! 

This is a directory free for anyone to take a look at, it's just my own stuff I work on for fun and for learning 

Code/Scraper is an application that I started with on the prompt of the Google Data Analytics course after I wrote up a SOW Scope of Work for
an imaginary project. 

I was tired of just listening to the videos and doing basic stuff in spreadsheets so I started with the project that is a 
web scraper that specifically targets financial news and scrapes the HTML code using Scrapy. The articles are then cleaned and processed in two 
separate scripts cleaner.py and analyzer.py. I use pandas for data handling and nltk (natural language toolkit) for analysis tools. 

I tokenize the texts into separate words as well as give them a sentiment score. I created a Jupyter notebook (EDA_finscraper) to be able to 
visualize and explore the data further. That's pretty much how far I've gotten, I hope automate the scraping to expand my database, and increase 
the number of pages. Perhaps even start gathering data from X, my ambition is to create an interactive dashboard using Dash before I consider this 
project good enough.
